# 💳 Bank Card Application File Generator

A modern, full-stack web application for generating standardized bank card request files from user data and customizable templates.

This tool simplifies the process of creating correctly formatted `.txt` files (like `output_powercard.txt`) that follow specific rules for field length, type, and required values — commonly used in banking and enterprise systems.

---

## 🧩 Why Use This Tool?

Manually generating bank card application files is time-consuming and error-prone. This app automates the process by:

- Allowing users to import data from `.json` files
- Validating all fields against a template (types, lengths, required)
- Applying default values when needed
- Saving all generated codes in a persistent database
- Exporting a clean, structured text file for submission

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Import Data**: Supports `.json` uploads
- 🧩 **Flexible Template**: Customize fields (name, length, type, required, default)
- ✅ **Validation Engine**: Enforces type and length rules with feedback
- 💾 **SQLite Database**: Stores all generated entries and their associated codes
- ⚙️ **Smart File Generation**: Outputs a bank-ready `output_powercard.txt`
- 🖥️ **Modern Frontend**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for ease of use
- 🔁 **RESTful API**: Flask backend with organized endpoints and clean separation of logic

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Hooks + functional components)
- Axios (for API communication)
- Tailwind CSS (for modern styling)

### Backend
- Python + Flask
- Flask-CORS (for cross-origin API requests)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM for SQLite database)
- Faker (for generating test data)

### Database
- SQLite (local development)

````

### Step 2: Set up the backend (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The API should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Step 3: Set up the frontend (React)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📝 How It Works

1. Upload a data file (`.json` or `.csv`)
2. Modify or confirm the field template
3. Click **Generate** to create your `output_powercard.txt`
4. All generated records are saved in the database with tracking codes
5. Download or inspect the final file

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Banks needing to batch-submit card application files
* FinTech tools needing to pre-format data for legacy systems
* Training / simulation tools for developers working on financial data pipelines

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* User authentication and roles
* Live preview of generated output
* Exporting to other formats (XML, Excel)
* Multi-language support (English, French...)
